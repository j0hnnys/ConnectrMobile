"Bringing the world to you."

This project was completed during a NBCUniversal's Hackathon. My group used Amazon's Echo to creating a new skill set for Alexa. 
We made it possible so that Alexa can send top trending Twitter data to our mobile app via voice interaction alone. All you have to
do is say "Alexa, get me latest twitter trends" and the everything else will be taken care of for you. All the hard work is done behind
the scenes making it easy and intuitive for the user.
